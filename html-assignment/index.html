    <main>
        <p> I love <em>web development</em>. This is because I found it very interesting! I embarked on my journey to learn it on January 8<sup>th</sup>. The changing part about creating and improving websites captivates me, and I am excited about looking into the complex topics of web development.</p>
        <p>I'm determined to absorb knowledge rapidly, aiming to learn as quickly as possible with the ultimate goal of securing a job <abbr title="as soon as possible">ASAP</abbr>. Each day brings new challenges and discoveries, making this journey both fulfilling and intellectually stimulating.</p>
